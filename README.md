# VeriNews_A-Fake-news-detection-using-machine-learning
Workflow of Fake News Prediction using machine learning with python

1. News Data in which the the news in cenceptual data the title of the news and the author of that news is there 

2. Data Pre Processing in which alot of work is to be done .
  as the computer is not understanding the conceptual data we have to convert it in numerical or we can say that machine language code.

3. nextly the dataset it into train test split in this we train our model

4. Nextly we have logistic Regression Model in this we classify based on the binary classification and basically it is of two types either real or fake 

5. After we trained the model we get the trained logistic regression model we feed the new data in it so that it predict whether the news is real or fake

I have attached the train.csv file for the dataset that I used in this model of Machine Learning Project.
